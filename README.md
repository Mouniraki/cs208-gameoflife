# Conway's Game of Life
## A simple game written in Assembly and working on an FPGA.
This project was the last one of the first semester of my 2nd year at EPFL, in the course "Computer Architecture I".  
It includes the VHDL files for the implementation of a simple Nios II processor on an FPGA, and an assembly file of the game.  
The project was realized with Omar El Malki, my teammate for the whole semester.
